//scenerio to create a counter and 2 button for increment and decrement
after making this interviewer asks
hooks is used to update data of variables in ui 

useState   =>const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0); //counter is variable and setCounter is function given by reacrt to update counter
it sends updates in ui in batches at single time so even if you do counter+1  multiple times
he sees all this as same work it takes it as single
        setCounter(counter + 1);
        setCounter(counter + 1);
        setCounter(counter + 1);
to avoid this and make it work each timewe useContext
        setCounter((prevCounter)=>prevCounter +1);
        setCounter((prevCounter)=>prevCounter +1);
        setCounter((prevCounter)=>prevCounter +1);
prevCounter is just name for state prev value
